# 🤖 Data First Transformer: Exploring Transformer Architectures Beyond Text

This project explores the application of **Transformer models** to real-world datasets beyond traditional NLP. It is aimed at understanding how attention-based architectures can be adapted for **tabular, time series, or hybrid** data scenarios.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Apply transformer-based models to structured or semi-structured datasets
- Compare performance with classical ML models (XGBoost, Random Forest)
- Implement custom transformer layers or use prebuilt models (e.g., TabTransformer)
- Experiment with embeddings, positional encodings, and attention mechanisms

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch / TensorFlow / Hugging Face Transformers
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Your first Transformers 🤖💬

This notebook introduces you to all of the possibilities that come with using HuggingFace Transformers for NLP.

To get started, we'll be using the intuitive `pipelines` library. You may find these documentation guides quite handy 👀:
